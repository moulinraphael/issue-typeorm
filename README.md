Repo to illustrate a Typeorm issue with `join` using two entities with an intermediary table (ManyToOne 
with both entities) : on the intermediary table, when `PRIMARY KEY` is on both entities' id attributes 
(instead of using id autogenerated), `join` doesn't return an empty array when there is no tuple persisted.

```
yarn install
yarn test
```
